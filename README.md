## Welcome!
This is the repository for the 'Ethical Open Data in Australian Environmental Archaeology' project. This README document introduces the project and how you can get involved.

## Ethical Uses of Open Data in Australian Environmental Archaeology
### The Problem
In archaeology, as in most other disciplines, the growing push towards open data is motivated by a range of complex but generally well-intentioned ideals associated with increasing accessibility and public benefit from research. However, while open science has enormous potential to benefit science and researchers, there is a risk that these same practices may be detrimental to some communities, particularly Indigenous communities whose Ancestors and ancestral homes are often the focus of research. 

### The Solution
This collaborative project engages Aboriginal communities and archaeologists in the development of guidelines for ethical approaches to open data in Australian environmental archaeology. The goal is to establish a community of practice and clear guidance around collaborative and equitable data sharing and stewardship so that Australian researchers working with palaeoenvironmental data can openly and fairly share and reuse data to benefit all while supporting Indigenous data sovereignty.
